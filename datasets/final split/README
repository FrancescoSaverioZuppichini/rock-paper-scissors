Important note: this dataset has not been properly anonymized yet (faces of some people could be visible) and should not be published online.
It is provided for review purposes only.


Each directory D1 -> D5 contains data acquired during a different day by different people.
c0 - rock
c1 - paper
c2 - scissors

Images in the "testing" directory are sampled from datasets D1 -> D4 (and are not included in directories D1 -> D4) and are evenly distributed among classes (33 rock, 34 paper, 33 scissors = 100 images)

Therefore one can use the following splits.
- Train on D1-D6, test on "testing" (easy, because testing images are from the same days/people of training images)
- Train on D1-D4 + "testing", test on D5-D6 (hard, because testing images are from a completely different day that is not represented in the training data)
